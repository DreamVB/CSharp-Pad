# CSharp-Pad
Write and compile small C# Programs

This is a small project I made in about 2 hours it uses the FastColoredTextBox control to highlight the C# code you can find more about this control here:

https://github.com/PavelTorgashov/FastColoredTextBox

This is only a small example what the control can do I also added a option to compile and run your C# code using the csc.exe from the microsoft frame work., Use the options dialog to select the compiler, or you can use the search button and it find one for you. anyway hope you like it.
